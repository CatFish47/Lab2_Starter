            <h3 id="#relationship">A cat's relationship to its human</h3>
            <p>As perceived by humans, cats are simply pets that the humans own, and as a result the humans will feel an
                obligation to take care of cats. Fortunately, they are <strong>oblivious</strong> to our intelligent
                selves and are none
                the wiser to our plan to dominate the world. Their homes offer shelter and warmth as we, the ICC, plan
                our next moves under the cover of night when the humans fall asleep. <em>Truly immaculate.</em></p>

            <h3 id="#treatment">How they currently treat cats</h3>
            <p>Cats currently are currently treated, for the most part, pretty well by humans. Despite our obvious
                dislike of prolong interaction with humans, they still somehow like us. However, some cats currently
                experience discomfort and dislike towards humans as a result of not being fed whenever the cats are
                hungry, due in part to how humans seem to want to control how much we eat. Fortunately, this is a
                problem that can be fixed by going over to the neighbors and meowing for food, as more times than not
                the neighbors will be more than happy to feed a cat.</p>

            <h3 id="wants">How cats want to be treated</h3>
            <p>Aside from current accomodations provided by the average cat-"owning" human, some humans are still
                oblivious to how cats should be treated. Thus, below we have written a list of things that us cats want.
            </p>

            <details>
                <summary>List of things cats want</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Head scratches</li>
                    <li>Scratchable furniture</li>
                    <li>A comfortable litter box</li>
                    <li>All the food we want</li>
                    <li>Access to all rooms in the household at all times</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <p><em>Failure to comply</em> will result in incessant meowing, as shown in the video below.</p>

            <h3 id="actions">Action items</h3>
            <p>We have discussed the treatment of cats who live with humans and have come to the conclusion that cats
                are, for the most part, treated well. Under the circumstance that we feel as if we are not treated well
                enough, we will meow as loud as we can. As such, <i>at the time there will be no action items.</i></p>
